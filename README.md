## 📄 Introduction

🏷 About me:
My nickname is Fulls, I write discord bots in the JavaScript and Python programming languages. I mainly use Python, as it is more convenient and pleasant for me to work with it.

## ⚙️ My projects

## 🔧 Drowned
A closed discord bot, with great functionality and capabilities. You have the opportunity to add a bot to your server by passing a special selection, more about this later. The bot positions itself as an assistant in setting up the server, the bot has a lot of useful utilities, commands for full control over the server. In general, the bot monitors the server very well.

## 🛡 Raxtro
Since 28.06.2021 - it is no longer supported by me, but it works in normal mode. A bot with little functionality and commands.

## 🔮 New-Year
A great bot for a level system with cards and events. I advise you to use it. On the server, I'm more like a support.
